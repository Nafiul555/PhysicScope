        <h2>Problem 1: A Three Body Problem and LISA</h2><br>
        <h4><b>Context:</b> Three body problem, as you may have learned from the TV show 
            (if you havent already seen it, check out the original chinese one), refers to three planetary objects in stationary orbit together.
            It means when they orbit around their star, their relative positions always remains the same and their center of mass always remains 
            on the same orbit. And LISA or Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is a proposed space probe to detect and accurately measure 
            gravitiational wave.
        </h4>
        <h3>1.1</h3><h5> This part of the problem asks to find the angular velocity of the line joining to objects orbiting the same point, which 
            happens to be their common center of mass.
        </h5>

        To solve, we first consider the angular frequecy from one of the planets POV. Click on the planets to see how the whole system suddenly looks
        like it got faster. That happens cause of fictitious forces. Since the planets are both moving, any observer on their surface wont feel
        their own planets motion, rather they would see the other planet going with a frequecy that is the sum of their indiviual ones:<br>
        from m's perspective, the force equation is $$mw_0^2r = \frac{GMm}{(R+r)^2}$$
        from M's perspective, the force equation, $$Mw_0^2R = \frac{GMm}{(R+r)^2}$$
        by taking reduced mass to account for the fictious forces, $$\frac{GMm}{M+m}w_0^2(R+r) = \frac{GMm}{(R+r)^2}$$<br>
        $$w_0 = \sqrt{\frac{M+m}{(R+r)^3}}$$
    </div>
      <div class="context"><h3>1.2</h3><br>
      In this part we add an infinitesimal mass \(\mu\) so that it also rotates around the common center of mass. as a result this mass is going 
    to look stationary from both M and m's POV</div>

      <div class="context">Since \(\mu\) is infinitesimal, it has no gravitational influences on the motion of neither M nor m. For \(\mu\) to remain stationary relative to both M and m, we must have:

        \[
        \frac{GM \mu}{r_1^2} \cos \theta_1 + \frac{Gm \mu}{r_2^2} \cos \theta_2 = \mu e_0^2 \rho = \frac{G(M + m) \mu}{(R + r)^3} \rho \tag{4}
        \]
        
        \[
        \frac{GM \mu}{r_1^2} \sin \theta_1 = \frac{Gm \mu}{r_2^2} \sin \theta_2 \tag{5}
        \]
        
        Substituting \(\frac{GM}{r_1^2}\) from Eq. (5) into Eq. (4), and using the identity
        
        \[
        \sin \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 + \cos \theta_1 \sin \theta_2 = \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
        \]
        
        we get:
        
        \[
        \frac{m \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}{r_2^2 }= \frac{(M + m)}{(R + r)^3} \rho \sin \theta_1 \tag{6}
        \]
        
        The distances \(r_2\) and \(\rho\), the angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are related by two Sine Rule equations:
        
        \[
        \frac{\sin \psi_1}{\rho} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{R}
        \]
        \[
        \sin \psi_1 r_2 = \frac{\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}{R + r} \tag{7}
        \]
        
        Substitute (7) into (6):
        
        \[
        \frac{1}{r_2^3} = \frac{R}{(R + r)^4} \frac{(M + m)}{m} \tag{10}
        \]
        since
        \[
         \frac{m}{M + m} = \frac{R}{R + r};
        \]
        we get from eq. 10 
        \[
        \quad r_2 = R + r
        \]
        
        By substituting \frac{Gm}{r_2^2} from Eq. (5) into Eq. (4), and repeating a similar procedure, we get:
        
        \[
        r_1 = R + r \tag{11},
        \]
        \[
        \quad r_2 = R + r \tag{12}
        \]
        
        \[r_1 = r_2\]
        
        so, the only way all three masses, of different units, would be in equilibrium and rotate around a common COM, is if they are positioned
        on the vertexes of a equilateral triangle
