            <h2>Problem 1: An Unusual Pendulum</h2><br>
            <h4><b>Context:</b> 
            In this problem we are given a disk on a slanted plane of angle /[/theta/]. A very basic setup. But what makes it interesting 
            is the Unusual build of the disk. Its of radius R and made of wood, but inside its curcumference, at a distance d 
            from the axis of symmetry is a metal disk of radius r.</h4>
            
            <h5>as you can see from the model, the disk rolls down the slanted plane for a very short period of time and then becomes still
            Our goal is to find the angle \[\phi\] that it rotates by before coming to a stop. Plase refer to this
            <a href="https://ipho.olimpicos.net/pdf/IPhO_2016_Q1.pdf">link</a> for the problem statement.
            </h5>

    <div class="context">
        The known quantities we have are the radius of the whole disk \( R \), the slanted angle \( \theta \), and the distance from 
        the axis of symmetry to the center of the metal ball \( d \). The disk is of mass \( M \) and the ball is of mass \( m \).<br>
        To solve this problem, we first need to find the forces and then the torque acting on the disk.<br>
        From the model, it's very clear that one of the forces is the component of gravity acting between the disk and the plank:
        
        \[
        F_{\text{along plank}} = mg\sin\theta
        \]
        
        This force will create a torque on the whole disk:
        
        \[
        T_{\text{plank force}} = (M+m)mg\sin\theta R \quad \text{-----(1)}
        \]
        
        Because the disk's center of mass is different from its axis of symmetry, it will also experience a torque due to gravity:
        
        \[
        T_{\text{gravity}} = \vec{b} \times (M+m)g = (M+m)gb\sin\phi \quad \text{-----(2)}
        \]
        
        Equating equations (1) and (2) gives us:
        
        \[
        (M+m)mg\sin\theta R = (M+m)gb\sin\phi
        \]
        
        Solving for \( \sin\phi \):
        
        \[
        \sin\phi = \frac{\sin\theta R}{b}
        \]
        
        In the problem's setup, I used \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{9} \), \( R = 4 \), and \( b = 1.75 \), and got \( \frac{51}{180}\pi \).
